## problem statement
**During the time of disaster, it becomes very difficult for the NDRF to connect with trained NCC/NSS volunteers because of various reasons that they are not involved with community or change of contact numbers etc. There is a requirement to create a system/software where these all volunteers can be enrolledNDRF is carrying out various awareness programs since its inception which involves the NCC/NSS volunteers. After a certain period, the contact with these volunteers is lost thus making the efforts futile.a) On a click of a Button, all connects can be activated. b) They can also be informed about various programs and periodical material can also be shared with all of them. c) These activities will keep them connected, interested, and involved. d) These resources can be used in any eventuality. These will be registered District wise, thus making them available in every district**
